Lately I've been interested in creating video games, but I don't have enough money or time
to create one. So I decided to start from scratch and that's why here's my very own tic-tac-toe
I probably won't receive many updates due to my lack of time and money, but there will be updates.
such as bug fixes, implementation of features, or even something completely different from the original game
And that's because I want it to be unique, to have things that other Tic-Tac-Toe games don't have, but
I know this game might not have a future, given that so many others are doing better things.
If you find a bug in the game, you can report it to my account privately; I will read them all.
